Indoor farming is fun, but water chemistry is tedious. 
This project will take out the hard work and allow you to grow like a pro without the advanced knowledge of hydroponics. 

This is my first attempt at coding a microcontroller, i spent many hours on Youtube and GPT to get to where I am. 
I have a feeling this is not nearly the most efficient way to be doing these functions, you might even get a chuckle out of it. But it was my honest first attempt, and I'm ready to learn.
